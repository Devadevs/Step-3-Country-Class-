# Objective:

For each of the indicators chosen for the dataset, we wanted to implement a class that allows us to create new instances with each of these attributes. In country.py we defined each of the attibutes and variables associated with each object as listed in the data. We also implemented getter and setter operations so that each variable can be retrieved and set easily when the class is called in the main function. In main.py, we created an instance of the "Country" class and used the dot operator to assign variables to each of the variables. For each variable assignment we also printed the variables to ensure that the code was functioning properly.
